# Pelicans UI

Pelicans UI is a lightweight, guild-flavored addon designed to add a bit of fun to your everyday gameplay. It brings custom emotes, upgraded ready-check feedback, animated meme sharing via player context menus, and a simple “Awards” feature to celebrate (or roast) your friends in group content.

## Features

**Emotes**: View and use custom guild emotes in-game.
**Ready-check boost**: Extra visuals and sounds for the native ready-check.
**PeliMeme**: Send and receive short animated memes to a target or your group via right-click player menu. Never triggers while in combat.
**Pelican Awards**: As group/raid leader, display a short “distinction” for a member (limited to once per minute).
**Global mute**: Option to disable all addon sounds.
**Minimap access**: Quick toggle and access via a minimap icon.
